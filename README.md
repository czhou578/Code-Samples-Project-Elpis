# Code-Samples-Project-Elpis
## No runnable app here. Just some code samples and files.

These are code samples from my Summer 2021 work opportunity for Project Elpis, a serverless web based application designed
to help underprivileged students track their post secondary career progress. Teachers are able to upload & assign different learning pathways
to students and fill out forms to document progress. This can then be seen by students and parents.

This application is currently being tested with over 100 students in a New York City public school.

Screenshots of app that I worked on:

These are some screenshots of the wireframes that were used in the initial design.
